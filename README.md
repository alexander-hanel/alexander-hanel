- 👋 Hello, I’m @alexander-hanel
- 👀 I’m interested in reverse engineering, malware, cryptography, program analysis and programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to improve my foundational knowledge of math and program analysis. 
- 📕 I wrote the [Beginner's Guide to IDAPython](https://leanpub.com/IDAPython-Book). 
- 📓 I blog (rarely) at [Hooked-On-Mnemonic](http://hooked-on-mnemonics.blogspot.com/).
- 📝 I commonly forget code so I'm usually posting snippets to my [gist](https://gist.github.com/alexander-hanel). 
- 🏡 The rest of the time I'm either with my family, dog, in my garage, playing video games or reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38655520-alexander-h-l).
